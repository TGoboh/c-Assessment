# Overview
This project tests the User Registration, User Login, View Account balance, Transfer funds, and Logout endpoints using c# Nunit.
The test cases cover positive and negative scenarios, ensuring proper authentication, authorization, and error-handling validation.

# Assumptions
The API requires a valid JWT token for authorization, and it follows the Bearer token format.
The status codes returned are consistent with standard HTTP responses (200, 401, 403, and 404).
